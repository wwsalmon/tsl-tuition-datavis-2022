        Total spending varies by school, ranging from <strong>$<!-- -->6<!-- -->2<!-- -->M by Pitzer to $<!-- -->1<!-- -->7<!-- -->9<!-- -->M by Pomona</strong> in the 2019-20 school year.
    </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        The schools have a range of student populations. Per student, spending ranged from $58K at Pitzer to $104K at Pomona in 2019-20.
    </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Though each 5C school categorizes their expenses in a slightly different way, the reports show that spending generally falls into three large buckets.
    </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p><strong>Academics† are the biggest spending category at every <!-- -->5<!-- -->C school.</strong> This includes faculty and staff salaries, faculty and student research grants, academic department expenses and related spending on The Hive, the Benton Museum and each college’s libraries.</p><p style="font-size:12px" idyll="[object Object]">†”academic programs” at Scripps and Pitzer; “instruction”, “research” and “academic support” at Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd and Pomona. Expenses related to the Dean of Students and Registrar offices are included in the former two schools but fall under “student services” in the latter.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Co-curricular spending is the next biggest spending category. The category includes residential life, dining and catering services, career development, mentorship groups, athletics, and other student support programs.†</p><p style="font-size:12px" idyll="[object Object]">†”co-curricular programs” at Scripps and Pitzer, “auxiliary enterprises” and “student services” at CMC, HMC and Pomona. “Student services” includes admissions, financial aid and registrar offices, while these expenses are categorized under “marketing,” “marketing” and “academic programs” respectively by schools that use those categories.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Institutional support† is the last major spending category, including administrative, finance, investment, alumni relations and communications offices, as well as admissions and financial aid at Scripps and Pitzer.†</p><p style="font-size:12px" idyll="[object Object]">†”institutional support” at CMC, HMC and Pomona, “marketing” and “general and administrative” at Scripps and Pitzer.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>Per-student expenses increased by more than national inflation at CMC, Pomona and Scripps from 2013-14 to 2019-20.

Is there a rock climbing wall? There is a desire to have a very hands on student affairs [and support in addition to] the instruction side.”</p><p>Rachael Warecki, News &amp; Strategic Communications Specialist at Scripps College, also pointed to increased co-curricular spending as a key reason for increasing expenses.</p><p>“Costs related to the <strong>addition of a new Residence Hall, together with major renovations</strong> to several other Residence Halls, including the addition of air conditioning and addressing ADA accessibility, was a major driver of costs in co-curricular expenditures for [Scripps] College over recent years,” she said.</p><img src="https://tsl.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Matejka_Scripps-Colonial1-1500x1000.jpg" alt="photo"/><p>Academic and institutional support expenses have also increased.</p><p>Rob Goldberg, COO and treasurer at Pomona College, pointed to the need to provide competitive salaries as a driver of increasing expenses.</p><p>“Over 50% of our budget covers <strong>salaries and benefits for our faculty and staff</strong> and each year we increase compensation to keep up with higher costs of living and to recruit and attract the best faculty and staff we can,” he said in an email.</p><p>Broadly, “<strong>people, insurance, food and utilities</strong>” were responsible for the greatest increases in Pitzer College’s expenses, Pitzer spokesperson Wendy Sattuck said in an email.</p><hr style="margin:96px 0"/><p>But increasing expenses don’t tell the whole story.

So she’s choosing to pursue English.

Growth in endowments, gifts, and other revenue streams all play a part in offsetting cost drivers.”</p><p>Pomona is the only “endowment-dependent” 5C school, receiving the majority of its revenue from endowment income. Even so, the school’s finances depend heavily on student revenue, according to Goldberg.</p><p>“We froze tuition during the pandemic and that was a hard year for us financially,” he said. “Most of our costs grow year over year, especially as we start to expand and evolve the college and do more things. We’ve got the right financial structure to do it, but some of that falls on student revenue.”</p><p>In particular, Goldberg said that it would be difficult to lower tuition without compromising on the school’s services.</p><p>“Keeping tuition low…just means that service isn’t being performed, which ultimately undermines what we’re able to provide students and faculty in terms of support,” he said. “Growing the endowment [takes] some pressure off tuition, but we’re never going to be zero tuition [increases].”</p><p>According to Goldberg, this is true not just for Pomona, but also for all similar-sized schools.</p><p>“All of our peer institutions, and any college university in the country, are raising tuition for these very reasons,” he said. “I don’t think any school has found a model where [not increasing tuition] works.”</p><p>In an email to TSL, HMC Director of Public Relations Judy Augsburger said that “in recent years, the College has taken steps to reduce, incrementally, the rate of annual increase [in tuition].” But the effects of these steps are yet to become visible: since 2013-14 Harvey Mudd’s tuition has increased 30.6%, and its 2021-22 tuition was the highest of the 5C schools.</p><p>Until the 5Cs meaningfully slow tuition increases, increasing costs are likely to continue weighing on students’ experiences.</p><p>“I’ve pretty much accepted that tuition is going to increase every year,” said Lee. “[Balancing intellectual pursuits and careerism] is an eternal struggle that students have, but the high tuition just complicates that even more and adds guilt, and a lot of other worries that wouldn’t be there otherwise.”</p><hr style="margin:96px 0"/><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><p>This data visualization piece was created by Samson Zhang using Idyll, React, Recharts and d3.
