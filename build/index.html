        Total spending varies by school, ranging from $62M at Pitzer to $179M at Pomona in the 2019-20 school year.
    </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        The schools have a range of student populations. Per student, spending ranged from $58K at Pitzer to $104K at Pomona in 2019-20.
    </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Though each 5C school categorizes their expenses in a slightly different way, the reports show that spending generally falls into three large groups.
    </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Academics† are the biggest spending category at every 5C school. This includes faculty and staff salaries, faculty and student research grants, academic department expenses and related spending on The Hive, the Benton Museum and each college’s libraries.</p><p style="font-size:12px" idyll="[object Object]">†”academic programs” at Scripps and Pitzer; “instruction”, “research” and “academic support” at Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd and Pomona. Expenses related to the Dean of Students and Registrar offices are included in the former two schools but fall under “student services” in the latter.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Co-curricular spending is the next biggest spending category. It includes residential life, dining and catering services, career development, mentorship groups, athletics, and other student support programs.†</p><p style="font-size:12px" idyll="[object Object]">†”co-curricular programs” at Scripps and Pitzer, “auxiliary enterprises” and “student services” at CMC, HMC and Pomona. “Student services” includes admissions, financial aid and registrar offices, while these expenses are categorized under “marketing,” “marketing” and “academic programs” respectively by schools that use those categories.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
        Institutional support† is the last major spending category, including administrative, finance, investment, alumni relations and communications offices, as well as admissions and financial aid at Scripps and Pitzer.†</p><p style="font-size:12px" idyll="[object Object]">†”institutional support” at CMC, HMC and Pomona, “marketing” and “general and administrative” at Scripps and Pitzer.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>Per-student expenses increased by more than national inflation at all 5C schools except Pitzer from 2013-14 to 2019-20.

Is there a rock climbing wall? There is a desire to have a very hands on student affairs [and support in addition to] the instruction side.”</p><p>Rachael Warecki, a spokesperson for Scripps, also pointed to increased co-curricular spending as a key reason for increasing expenses.</p><p>“Costs related to the addition of a new Residence Hall, together with major renovations to several other Residence Halls, including the addition of air conditioning and addressing ADA accessibility, was a major driver of costs in co-curricular expenditures for [Scripps] College over recent years,” she said.</p><div style="margin:48px 0" idyll="[object Object]"><img src="https://tsl.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Matejka_Scripps-Colonial1-1500x1000.jpg" alt="Photo of Toll Hall, a residence hall at Scripps College"/><p style="font-size:16px" idyll="[object Object]">Residence hall renovations were major contributors to expenditure increases at Scripps, according to Warecki. (Janey Matejka • The Student Life)</p></div><p>Academic and institutional support expenses have also increased.</p><p>According to Rob Goldberg, Pomona Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer, part of the increase stems from the need to provide competitive salaries.</p><p>“Over 50% of our budget covers salaries and benefits for our faculty and staff and each year we increase compensation to keep up with higher costs of living and to recruit and attract the best faculty and staff we can,” he said in an email.</p><p>Judy Augsburger, a spokesperson for Harvey Mudd, said that a <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/growth/">2013 ten-year growth plan</a> was a key reason for the steepness of the college’s tuition increases since 2011-12. The plan called for increasing faculty, staff and facility resources to accommodate 900 students by 2023. Harvey Mudd <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/institutional-research/institutional-statistics/institutional-statistics-students/student-enrollment/">had 902 full-time undergraduate students</a> in 2021-22, up from 777 in 2011-12.</p><p>Broadly, “people, insurance, food and utilities” were responsible for the greatest increases in Pitzer’s expenses, spokesperson Wendy Shattuck said via email.</p><hr style="margin:96px 0"/><h2 id="financial-aid-alleviates-some,-but-not-all,-consequences-of-rising-costs">Financial aid alleviates some, but not all, consequences of rising costs</h2><p>But increasing expenses don’t tell the whole story.

Claremont McKenna receives more of its revenue from students than from its endowment, but not a majority of total revenue.</p><p>“Most higher ed institutions are tuition dependent, and that impacts decisions on how many students to enroll and how much financial aid [Pitzer College] can provide,” Shattuck said via email. “All schools hope to be endowment-dependent, but that usually comes with age and large donations.”</p><p>Relying on student revenue is appropriate for Scripps College’s mission, according to Warecki.</p><p>“As our mission is to educate students the bulk of our revenue is generated from student revenues,” said Warecki via email. “Diversification of our revenue stream is beneficial but should still be in line with the mission and vision of the College. Growth in endowments, gifts, and other revenue streams all play a part in offsetting cost drivers.”</p><p>Pomona is the only “endowment-dependent” 5C school, receiving the majority of its revenue from endowment income. Even so, the school’s finances depend heavily on student revenue, according to Goldberg.</p><p>“We froze tuition during the pandemic and that was a hard year for us financially,” he said. “Most of our costs grow year over year, especially as we start to expand and evolve the college and do more things. We’ve got the right financial structure to do it, but some of that falls on student revenue.”</p><p>In particular, Goldberg said that it would be difficult to lower tuition without compromising on the school’s services.</p><p>“Keeping tuition static just means we would have to cut other parts of the budget...ultimately undermines what we’re able to provide students and faculty in terms of support,” he said. “Growing the endowment [takes] some pressure off tuition, but we’re never going to zero tuition [increases].”</p><p>According to Goldberg, this is true not just for Pomona, but also for all similar-sized schools.</p><p>“All of our peer institutions, and any college university in the country, are raising tuition for these very reasons,” he said. “I don’t think any school has found a model where [not increasing tuition] works.”</p><p>In an email to TSL, Augsburger said that “in recent years, the College has taken steps to reduce, incrementally, the rate of annual increase [in tuition].”</p><p>Harvey Mudd is the only 5C where per-year tuition increase rates have decreased or remained the same every year other than the 2020-21 tuition freeze due to COVID, from 4.5 percent in 2014-15 to 3.5 percent in 2021-22.</p><p>Still, Harvey Mudd’s tuition has increased 35.22 percent since 2013-14, and its 2021-22 tuition was the highest of the 5C schools.</p><p>Lee doesn’t expect tuition to stop increasing anytime soon.</p><p>“I’ve pretty much accepted that tuition is going to increase every year,” said Lee.</p><p>Until the 5Cs more meaningfully slow tuition increases, increasing costs are likely to continue weighing on students’ experiences.</p><hr style="margin:96px 0"/><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><p>This data visualization piece was created by <a href="https://tsl.news/author/samson-zhang/">Samson Zhang</a> using <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">Idyll</a>, React, <a href="https://recharts.org/en-US/">Recharts</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a>.
