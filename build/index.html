        CHANGE In part this is because the student population varies from school to school. But spending still ranged from <strong>$<!-- -->5<!-- -->8<!-- -->K per student at Pitzer</strong> to <strong>$<!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->4<!-- -->K per student at Pomona</strong> in the 2019-20 school year.

        Though each 5C school categorizes their expenses in a slightly different way, the reports show that spending generally falls into three large buckets.
